            <h2>Time Travel</h2>
            <p>Could we ever travel through time? Discover theories that challenge our understanding of reality.</p>
	    <div class="separator" style="text-align: center;"></div>
	    <p>Time travel is the concept of moving between different points in time, much like we move through space. While it remains a popular theme in science fiction, some theories in physics suggest it could be possible. Einstein’s theory of relativity allows for time dilation, where time slows down for objects moving at high speeds. Wormholes and black holes are also thought to potentially offer shortcuts through time. However, paradoxes—like the famous "grandfather paradox"—raise questions about its feasibility. Whether time travel will ever become a reality remains one of the greatest mysteries of science.</p>

            <h2>Multiverse Theory</h2>
            <p>Is our universe just one of many? Explore the fascinating idea of parallel worlds.</p>
	    <div class="separator"></div>
	    <p>The Multiverse Theory suggests that our universe is just one of many, existing in a vast cosmic network of parallel realities. These universes may have different physical laws, alternate versions of history, or even other versions of ourselves. Scientists propose various explanations, such as quantum mechanics and cosmic inflation, to support this mind-bending idea. While still theoretical, the multiverse concept challenges our understanding of existence and raises profound questions about reality.</p>

            <h2>Wormholes</h2>
            <p>Shortcuts through space-time could be the key to interstellar travel. But do they really exist?</p>
	    <div class="separator"></div>
	    <p>Wormholes are hypothetical passages through space-time that could create shortcuts between distant points in the universe. Predicted by Einstein’s theory of general relativity, these cosmic tunnels might allow for faster-than-light travel and even time travel. However, their existence remains purely theoretical, as they would require exotic matter with negative energy to stay open. If proven real, wormholes could revolutionize our understanding of space exploration and the nature of reality itself.</p>

            <h2>Dark Matter & Dark Energy</h2>
            <p>Most of the universe is invisible and mysterious. What are these unknown forces shaping our cosmos?</p>
	    <div class="separator"></div>
	    <p>Dark matter and dark energy are mysterious forces that make up most of the universe. Dark matter, though invisible, is believed to provide the gravitational glue that holds galaxies together. Dark energy, on the other hand, is a force driving the accelerated expansion of the universe. Despite extensive research, their exact nature remains unknown, making them some of the biggest unsolved mysteries in modern astrophysics.</p>
