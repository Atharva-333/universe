		<h2>Planets</h2>
			<p>Planets are fascinating celestial bodies that orbit stars, each with unique characteristics and environments. In our Solar System, there are eight planets, ranging from the rocky inner planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—to the massive gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn, and the icy giants, Uranus and Neptune. Planets come in various sizes and compositions, some with thick atmospheres, swirling storms, or vast oceans of ice. Many planets also have natural satellites, or moons, that accompany them in their journey through space. Beyond our Solar System, thousands of exoplanets have been discovered, each offering new insights into the diversity of planetary systems across the universe.</p>

		<h2>Stars</h2>
			<p>Stars are immense, glowing spheres of hot plasma held together by gravity, generating energy through nuclear fusion in their cores. They come in various sizes, colors, and temperatures, from the cool, red dwarfs to the massive, blue supergiants. Our Sun, a relatively small yellow dwarf star, is the closest star to Earth and sustains life by providing heat and light. Stars form in vast clouds of gas and dust known as nebulae, evolving over millions or even billions of years. Some end their lives as dense neutron stars or even collapse into black holes, while others explode in spectacular supernovae, scattering elements across the universe. These cosmic beacons illuminate galaxies and play a crucial role in the cycle of cosmic creation and destruction.</p>

        <h2>Galaxies</h2>
        <p>Galaxies are immense cosmic structures composed of billions of stars, planets, nebulae, dark matter, and interstellar dust, bound together by gravity. They come in various shapes and sizes, including spiral galaxies like the Milky Way, elliptical galaxies, and irregular galaxies. Each galaxy is a vast and dynamic system where stars are born, evolve, and die, contributing to the cosmic cycle of matter. The universe is home to trillions of galaxies, each with its own unique composition and mysteries. Some galaxies contain supermassive black holes at their centers, influencing their evolution and structure. Studying galaxies helps astronomers understand the origins of the universe, the formation of celestial bodies, and the fundamental forces shaping the cosmos.</p>

        <h2>Moons</h2>
        <p>Moons, also known as natural satellites, are celestial bodies that orbit planets and even some asteroids. They vary greatly in size, composition, and geological activity. Earth's Moon, the most well-known, influences tides and has a barren, cratered surface. Some moons, like Jupiter's Europa and Saturn's Enceladus, are covered in ice and may harbor subsurface oceans, making them prime candidates for extraterrestrial life. Others, like Io, are volcanically active, reshaping their surfaces over time. Moons play a crucial role in stabilizing their planets’ orbits and can provide key insights into the history of planetary systems. With ongoing space exploration, these fascinating worlds continue to reveal new secrets about our universe.</p>

    <section id="asteroids">
        <h2>Asteroids</h2>
        <p>Asteroids are rocky, airless remnants from the early solar system, primarily found in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. These celestial bodies vary in size, from small pebbles to massive structures spanning hundreds of kilometers. Unlike planets, asteroids lack atmospheres and have irregular shapes due to their weak gravity. Some, like Ceres, are large enough to be classified as dwarf planets, while others, like Apophis, occasionally pass close to Earth. Scientists study asteroids to understand the building blocks of planets and the history of our solar system. They also pose potential threats, as impacts from large asteroids have shaped Earth's history, including the extinction of the dinosaurs. Ongoing missions, such as NASA’s OSIRIS-REx, aim to uncover more about these ancient space travelers.</p>

    <section id="comets">
        <h2>Comets</h2>
        <p>Comets are icy celestial bodies that travel through the solar system in elongated orbits, often developing brilliant tails when they approach the Sun. Composed of rock, dust, and frozen gases, comets originate from regions like the Kuiper Belt and the distant Oort Cloud. As they near the Sun, heat causes their icy cores to vaporize, creating a glowing coma and a tail that can stretch millions of kilometers. Some of the most famous comets, such as Halley’s Comet, have been observed for centuries and follow predictable orbits. Scientists study comets because they are remnants from the early solar system, preserving clues about its formation and the origins of water and organic molecules on Earth. These cosmic wanderers continue to captivate astronomers and stargazers alike.</p>

    <section id="blackholes">
        <h2>Black Holes</h2>
        <p>Black holes are mysterious and powerful cosmic entities with gravitational forces so strong that nothing—not even light—can escape once it crosses the event horizon. They form when massive stars collapse under their own gravity at the end of their life cycles. Black holes come in different sizes, from stellar-mass black holes to supermassive black holes found at the centers of galaxies, including the one in our Milky Way, known as Sagittarius A. Despite being invisible, black holes can be detected by their influence on nearby objects and the radiation emitted as matter falls into them. Scientists continue to study black holes to unlock secrets about space, time, and the very fabric of the universe, making them one of the most fascinating and enigmatic celestial phenomena.</p>
